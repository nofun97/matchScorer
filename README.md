# matchScorer
This is a code for the first project of COMP10001 Foundations of Computing 2017 Semester 1

## explanation
So this code basically finds the total score of a tennis game and this code was exposed to many different kinds of cases
It takes an array of 0 and 1, 0 means it is a score to player zero and 1 means it is a score to player one, from that long array, the code will then take care of finding the total of the score.
In detail, the code will output the total matches, the total sets, and the total score for the last game, if it is incomplete.
